		<h1>Summary</h1>

		<p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio! I am a recent graduate of DevMountain with a passion for web development. My interest in web development began in High School when I had the opportunity to redesign my school’s website using <span class="green">PHP and MySQL.</span></p>

		<p>While at DevMountain I was able to expand my knowledge and experience while learning <span class="green">React, Angular, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, NodeJS</span> and many other technologies that you can check out in the “Skills” section below.</p>

		<p>I love the web industry and enjoy the challenges of learning new technologies as they are always progressing and developing.  I also love being able to code and see my projects take shape.</p>

		<p>If you want to know more about me you can check out my resume or shoot me a message on Linkedin!</p>
