		<h1>Summary</h1>

		<p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio! I am a recent graduate of DevMountain with a passion for web development. My interest in web development began in High School when I had the opportunity to redesign my schoolâ€™s website using <span class="green">PHP and MySQL.</span></p>

		<p>While at DevMountain I was able to expand my knowledge and experience while learning <span class="green">React, AngularJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, NodeJS</span> and many other technologies.</p>

		<p>Most recently, I have been working with a company specializing in Augmented Reality. I have been able to use <span class="green">Angular 4</span> to build internal tools used to place and display objects on a map, run analytics and other tasks.</p>

		<p>I enjoy the challenges of learning new technologies and being able to code and see my projects take shape. If you want to know more about me, you can check out my resume or shoot me a message on Linkedin!</p>
